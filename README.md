# hello-world

Hello everyone. This is a my first repository on GitHub

I'm an aspiring developer, my main interest is game development, and I have programmed in languagues like Java, JavaScript, Python and Haskell.

I hope that i can use this account to post some projects like small games or some simple things made for fun.

And, if my English is flawless, even though I don't think so, I'm brazilian, hehe :)
